      <p> The goal of this study is a new way to visualize speech and differentiate between two different kinds of speakers. Can we create a visual to represent different speaking styles? How can we make a tool that takes in audio or video and outputs a visualization of that specific speaking style, and allows you to compare it to other speakers? Other studies/papers have focused on visualizing speech, but not in an easily digestible manner for an entire speech. The project has an interface to allow users differentiate two different speakers visually. Some possible use cases for this include a website to compare a user's speeches to famous speeches, and get insight on how to become a better public speaker.</p>
