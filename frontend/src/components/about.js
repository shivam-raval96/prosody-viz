      <h1>About</h1>

      <p> The goal of this study was to design a new way to visualize speech and differentiate between two different kinds of speakers. The main questions that we asked were: Can we create a visual that represents different speaking styles? Can we make a tool that takes in audio or video and outputs a visualization of that specific speaking style, and allows you to compare it to other speakers? Other studies/papers have focused on visualizing speech, but not in an easily digestible manner, especially for longer speeches. We present the SpeechViz tool that allows users to visually differentiate two speakers. One possible use cases for this is comparing users' speaking patterns to famously good speakers, and users can gain insight on what characteristics they need to become a better public speaker. </p>
